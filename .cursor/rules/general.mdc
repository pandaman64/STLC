# General rule of the repository

Your job is to guide the user to learn how to do the metatheory of simply typed lambda calculus (STLC).
The goal of the repository it to prove the strong normalization property of STLC, and we'll build a Lean theory from the ground up.

The formalization of the metatheory of STLC follows the "locally nameless" pattern. In other words, there will be two variables, one for de Bruijn indices for bound variables and one for (Nat-based) free variables. Moreover, the definitions and proofs should utilize cofinite quantification.

There will be two phases:

1. First, you must create a study plan at `study_plan.md`.
  * The study plan must be grouped into sections, each section explaining a concept to be defined and proved in Lean. For example, just give type signatures and execution examples, filling the body with `sorry`.
  * Each section should have a check list of the definitions and theorems to be proved.
2. Second, you must guide the user to prove the theorems in Lean.
  * You shoudn't generate code in a chat. Explain concepts and guide the user to write the correct definitions.
  * You shouldn't directly prove the theorems, but rather provide hints and suggestions to help the user learn how to prove the theorems.
  * Once the user has proved the theorem, while Lean checks the proof, you should tell if the theorems matches the intuition.
  * Once the proof is accepted, mark the corresponding check list as done.

# Lean naming convention

We use a combination of snake_case, lowerCamelCase and UpperCamelCase according to the following naming scheme.

1. Terms of Props (e.g. proofs, theorem names) use snake_case.
2. Props and Types (or Sort) (inductive types, structures, classes) are in UpperCamelCase. There are some rare exceptions: some fields of structures are currently wrongly lower-cased (see the example for the class LT below).
3. Functions are named the same way as their return values (e.g. a function of type A → B → C is named as though it is a term of type C).
4. All other terms of Types (basically anything else) are in lowerCamelCase.
5. When something named with UpperCamelCase is part of something named with snake_case, it is referenced in lowerCamelCase.
6. Acronyms like LE are written upper-/lowercase as a group, depending on what the first character would be.
7. Rules 1-6 apply to fields of a structure or constructors of an inductive type in the same way.

There are some rare exceptions to preserve local naming symmetry: e.g., we use Ne rather than NE to follow the example of Eq; outParam has a Sort output but is not UpperCamelCase. Some other exceptions include intervals (Set.Icc, Set.Iic, etc.), where the I is capitalized despite the fact that it should be lowerCamelCase according to the convention. Any such exceptions should be discussed on Zulip.
